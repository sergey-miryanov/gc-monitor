"""Reconstructing the GC records a poll could not read.

CPython writes one record per finished GC run, and a target whose collector
runs faster than gcmon polls overwrites records before any poll reads them. Two
cumulative fields make the loss measurable: ``collections`` counts how many GC
runs finished, and ``duration`` gives the total pause time of those runs.

``EventsMonitor`` owns one ``RingAccumulator`` per ``(pid, iid, gen)``.
