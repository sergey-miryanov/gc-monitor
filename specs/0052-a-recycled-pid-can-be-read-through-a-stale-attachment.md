# 0052: Refuse to read a pid whose process changed underneath gcmon

- **Status:** Not started
- **Kind:** bug (correctness)
- **Effort:** M
- **Origin:** spec 0048 section 6, retired, see [RETIRED.md](RETIRED.md); filed once
  [ADR-0020](../docs/adr/0020-attach-to-a-process-once.md) existed to cite
- **Respects:** [ADR-0020](../docs/adr/0020-attach-to-a-process-once.md) (an attachment is dropped
  on every failed read, and revalidating on each read is rejected),
  [ADR-0017](../docs/adr/0017-monitor-owns-the-pid-lifecycle.md) (the pid epoch is what keeps a
  successor out of its predecessor's figures)

## 1. Problem

An operator attaches gcmon to a long-lived process tree on Linux. One worker exits between two
ticks and the kernel hands its pid straight to a new process. gcmon never sees a failed read: the
worker was there on the tick before and something is there on the tick after, so it goes on
reading that pid through the attachment it already held. The trace it produces contains GC records
for that worker that no collection ever produced: plausible pause durations, plausible counters,
drawn on the worker's own track. The operator has no way to tell them from the real ones, and no
warning is printed.

## 2. Evidence

`gcmon.events_reader.RemoteEventsReader` keeps one `_remote_debugging.GCMonitor` per pid and reuses
it for every read until a read fails. `GCMonitor` resolves the target's runtime address and debug
offsets when it is constructed and revalidates neither afterwards; the reads it performs are raw
remote-memory copies at addresses derived from that one-time resolution.

Two facts make the result data rather than an error:

1. **Nothing on the read path validates.** Every field gcmon consumes (`gen`, `iid`, `collections`,
   `ts_start`, `ts_stop`, `heap_size`, `duration`) is an integer or a double copied out of the
   target. The only filter is `gcmon.monitor`'s completeness check, which rejects a slot whose
   `ts_start` is not below its `ts_stop`. Arbitrary memory satisfies that roughly half the time.
2. **The successor is a Python process of the same build**, in the case that matters. A recycled pid
   under a fan-out is very often the *same worker program being restarted*, so the address gcmon
   resolved is very likely still mapped and still holds a `gc_stats` structure, just a different
   one, with counters that have nothing to do with the ring gcmon was tracking.

`gcmon.monitor.EventsMonitor` cannot see this either. Its prune keys on the child listing, and the
pid never left it. The cursor comparison is what turns fresh counters into a loss window, and here
the counters are not fresh, merely unrelated.

**This is a change of consequence, not a new defect.** ADR-0017 was written about the same window:
before this, the worst case was a successor's records attributed to its predecessor's cursor, which
made a number wrong. `GCMonitor`'s cached offsets change the worst case to records fabricated out of
an unrelated process's memory.

## 3. Scope

**Affected:**

- Linux and macOS, every subcommand that monitors live (`gcmon run`, `gcmon monitor`), every
  `--format`. Worse the wider the fan-out and the shorter the child lifetimes, because both raise
  the chance of a recycle inside one tick.

**Not affected:**

- **Windows.** Attaching opens a process handle, and a held handle keeps the process object alive,
  so the kernel will not reissue that pid while gcmon is attached (ADR-0020). The scenario is
  impossible there, not merely unlikely.
- **`gcmon combine`** and every offline path: no reads, no attachments.
- **A pid recycled while gcmon is *not* attached**, after a failed read or after the pid left the
  child listing. ADR-0020's lifetime already drops the attachment in both, so the next read attaches
  afresh.
- **`get_child_pids`.** Stateless and re-derived every tick.

**Why the suite does not catch it.** Every test of the prune drives a pid *leaving* the listing or a
policy *giving up*, because those are the routes gcmon can observe. There is no test of a pid that
stays in the listing while the process behind it changes, because no seam gcmon has can currently
tell that happened. That is the gap this spec closes, and the fix and the test need the same new
fact.

## 4. Proposed change

1. **Give a pid an identity beyond its number, taken once at attach.** The process start time is the
   one cheap identifier the OS keeps that a successor cannot inherit: field 22 of `/proc/<pid>/stat`
   on Linux, `kinfo_proc.p_starttime` on macOS. Record it alongside the attachment.
2. **Compare on the tick boundary, not on the read.** ADR-0020 rejects revalidating inside `read`,
   and that decision holds: a probe per read reintroduces a per-poll syscall against the target,
   which is the cost attaching once exists to remove. The comparison belongs in the pruning pass the
   monitor already makes once per tick, the same pass that reconciles the child listing.
3. **A pid whose start time changed is treated as a departure and an arrival, in that order.** Drop
   the attachment, drop the cursors, settle the statistics and advance the pid epoch, then let the
   next poll attach afresh. That is precisely what happens today when a pid leaves the listing and
   returns, so the machinery exists; what is new is the trigger.
4. **Say so once, at warning level.** A recycled pid under monitoring is a fact about the operator's
   workload that changes how they should read the trace, and unlike the ordinary departure it is
   invisible in the process listing.

**Rejected: comparing start times inside `read`.** The obvious fix, and it loses: a syscall per pid
per poll, the same shape as the cost 0048 removed, and a platform-specific probe on the hot path
for a condition that can only change between ticks anyway.

**Rejected: making the pid epoch part of what the reader keys on.** It moves the problem rather than
solving it: the epoch only advances when gcmon *notices* the death, which is the thing it cannot do.

**Open, and what would settle it:** whether the start-time read belongs behind the existing
`EventsReader` seam or beside it as a separate collaborator. What settles it is whether anything
other than the reader ever needs a process's identity. If the answer stays no, it belongs to the
reader.

## 5. Seams and testing decisions

- **Seam:** the injected `EventsReader`, plus whatever `psutil`-or-equivalent seam the start-time
  read lands behind. Both are already injected, so a test can hand the monitor a pid whose identity
  changes between two ticks without needing a real recycle, which is untestable: no test can make
  the kernel reissue a chosen pid.
- **New seam needed:** the process-identity read has to be injectable. It is the only new one, and
  it is required: the whole defect is about a value the test must control.
- **What makes a good test here:** assert on what reached the exporter and the statistics. The
  fabricated-record case has a specific signature, records under the *old* pid epoch with counters
  unrelated to the tracked ring, and the fix's signature is a settled block for the predecessor and
  a fresh one for the successor. Asserting that the attachment was dropped proves the prune ran, not
  that the trace came out right.
- **Prior art:** `tests/monitoring/test_monitor.py::TestARecycledPidStartsFromNothing`, which already
  models a pid leaving and returning with an unrelated counter and asserts no loss window is drawn.
  This is the same shape with the departure hidden. Its control case, the same counters *without* a
  departure, which must still draw a loss window, is what gives the new assertion teeth and should
  be mirrored.
- **Cases:**
  1. A pid whose identity changes between two ticks, while staying in the child listing, settles its
     predecessor and starts the successor from nothing: no loss window, and the successor's records
     under a new pid epoch.
  2. The control: a pid whose identity is unchanged across a counter jump still draws the loss window
     ADR-0015 says it should. Without this, a fix that treated every tick as a recycle would pass.
  3. A pid whose identity cannot be read, because the process exited between the listing and the
     probe, is treated as a departure, not as an error.
  4. Regression guard: the attach count over a run of stable pids is unchanged. A fix that
     re-attaches on every tick would silently undo 0048, and only a count catches it.

## 6. Out of scope

- **Windows.** The handle pin makes the scenario impossible, so the identity read is a no-op there,
  and it should be written as one rather than as a platform branch with two live arms.
- **A record-level plausibility filter**, bounds on `duration` or monotonicity of `ts_start` against
  the previous record. Tempting, and a trap: it would reject some fabricated records and some real
  ones, and it would leave gcmon unable to say which. The problem is that gcmon read the wrong
  process, and the fix is to know that, not to grade the output.
- **Torn reads and reordered publishes**, which [0044](0044-torn-reads-and-reordered-publishes.md)
  owns. Those are races inside a target gcmon is correctly attached to. This is the opposite: a
  correct read of the wrong process.
- **The version-mismatch classification** 0048 section 6 also left open. It shares a cause with
  this, both wanting a failure gcmon can tell apart from "not started yet", but it wants
  `debug=False`, which means arguing against ADR-0020, and it is operator-facing where this is
  silent.
- **Anything about what a record means or how loss is computed.** ADR-0015 and ADR-0016 own those.

## 7. Further notes

The window is narrow and the consequence is severe, which is an awkward combination to prioritise.
Two things argue for taking it despite the narrowness: it is silent, so nobody will report it; and
the output is indistinguishable from a real measurement, so an operator who hits it draws a wrong
conclusion about their own workload rather than about gcmon.

Sizing note: the pid-epoch machinery, the settle-and-restart path and the prune pass all exist and
all do the right thing already. What this adds is one fact per attachment and one comparison per
tick. The M rather than S is the platform work and the test seam, not the logic.
